components, outer weight vectors, etc.).}
\usage{
rgccak(
  A,
  C,
  tau = "optimal",
  scheme = "centroid",
  verbose = FALSE,
  init = "svd",
  bias = TRUE,
  tol = 1e-08,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  scale = TRUE,
  scale_block = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A list that contains the \eqn{J} blocks of variables. It could be 
either the original matrices (\eqn{X_1, X_2, ..., X_J}) or the residual 
matrices (\eqn{X_{h1}, X_{h2}, ..., X_{hJ}}).}

\item{C}{A symmetric matrix (J*J) that describes the relationships between 
blocks.}

\item{tau}{Either a 1*J vector or a \eqn{\mathrm{max}(ncomp) \times J} matrix containing the values 
of the regularization parameters (default: tau = 1, for each block and each dimension). Tau varies from 0 (maximizing the correlation) to 1 (maximizing the covariance).
If tau = "optimal" the regularization paramaters are estimated for each block and each dimension using the Schafer and Strimmer (2005)
analytical formula . If tau is a \eqn{1\times J} vector, tau[j] is identical across the dimensions of block \eqn{\mathbf{X}_j}. 
If tau is a matrix, tau[k, j] is associated with \eqn{\mathbf{X}_{jk}} (\eqn{k}th residual matrix for block \eqn{j}). It can be estimated by using \link{rgcca_permutation}.}

\item{scheme}{A character or a function giving the link function for 
covariance maximization among "horst" (the identity function), "factorial"
 (the squared values), "centroid" (the absolute values). Only, the horst 
 scheme penalizes structural negative correlation. The factorial scheme 
 discriminates more strongly the blocks than the centroid one.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean displaying the warnings}

\item{init}{A character giving the mode of initialization to use in the algorithm. The alternatives are either by Singular Value Decompostion ("svd") or random ("random") (default: "svd").}

\item{bias}{A logical value for biaised (\eqn{1/n}) or unbiaised (\eqn{1/(n-1)}) estimator of the var/cov (default: bias = TRUE).}

\item{tol}{An integer giving the value for stopping the algorithm convergence.}

\item{na.rm}{If TRUE, RGCCA is run only on available data (default value) 
otherwise the NIPALS algorithm is used.}

\item{scale}{A logical value indicating if each block is normalised and divided by the square root of its number of variables and then divided by the square root of its number of variables.}

\item{scale_block}{A logical value indicating if each block have the same weight in the RGCCA analysis. Otherwise, the weight of each block depends on the number of variables of the block}
}
\value{
\item{Y}{A \eqn{n * J} matrix of block components}

\item{Z}{A \eqn{n * J} matrix of inner components}

\item{a}{A list of \eqn{J} elements. Each element of \eqn{a} is a 
matrix that contains the block weight vectors for each block.}

\item{converg}{Convergence of the algorithm to reach the tolerance.}

\item{AVE}{A list of numerical values giving the indicators of model 
quality based on the Average Variance Explained (AVE): AVE(for each block), 
AVE(outer model), AVE(inner model).}

\item{call}{Call of the function}

\item{crit}{A list of max(ncomp) elements. Each element 
(one per deflation stage) is a vector that contains the value of the RGCCA 
objective function across iterations.}

\item{tau}{Either a 1*J vector or a \eqn{\mathrm{max}(ncomp)\times J} 
matrix containing the values of the regularization parameters . The shrinkage 
parameter tau varies from 0 (maximizing the correlation) to 1 (maximizing the 
covariance). If tau = "optimal" the regularization paramaters are estimated 
for each block and each dimension using the Schafer and Strimmer (2005)
analytical formula . If tau is a \eqn{1\times J} vector, tau[j] is identical 
across the dimensions of block \eqn{\mathbf{X}_j}. If tau is a matrix, 
tau[k, j] is associated with \eqn{\mathbf{X}_{jk}} (\eqn{k}th residual matrix 
for block \eqn{j}). It can also be estimated by using 
\link{rgcca_permutation}.}

\description{
The function rgccak() is called by rgccad() and does not have to be used by 
the user. The function rgccak() computes the RGCCA block components, block 
weight vectors, etc., for each block and each dimension. Depending on the 
dimensionality of each block \eqn{X_j, j = 1, ..., J}, the primal 
(when \eqn{n > p_j}) or the dual (when \eqn{n < p_j}) algorithm is used 
(see Tenenhaus et al. 2015)
